One of the best ways to observe this concept is by tracking changes in the S&P 500 Index. The S&P acts as a snapshot that illuminates which companies and industries are the largest in the economy at any given time. By looking at five decades worth of changes to the component companies that make up the S&P, we are able to observe and illustrate trends and shifts in the economy. These changes can be seen on smaller yearly levels as well as bigger-picture views that look at change over decades or more. How Industry Has Changed Over the Last 50 Years When looking at this animated graphic displaying how the industries represented on the S&P change from year to year, a few things tend to jump out. First, the amount of change within the Industrials industry is drastic. In 1969, 166 of the 500 companies on the index, a full 33%, were in this industry, but now, there are only 70 Industrials companies represented.","related":"SP500","image":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/image\/37429fc1-fd72-485f-99f9-2e2390fe2e96","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1574283521000,"headline":"4 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: LOW, URBN, SPY and AMD","source":"InvestorPlace","url":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/article\/9fbd4d70-2408-4f30-a9e1-bbdd949b84f2","summary":"Lowe's Urban Outfitters, the S&P 500 ETF and Advanced Micro Devices were our top stock trades for Thursday.","related":"SP500","image":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/image\/9fbd4d70-2408-4f30-a9e1-bbdd949b84f2","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1574278343000,"headline":"The S&P cracks lower but not below the 100 hour MA","source":"Forexlive","url":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/article\/8968e821-0b93-4000-8deb-00fd63ea6461","summary":"The index has not been below the 100 hour MA since October 10th The S&P tumbled to new session lows off the latest US\/China headlines.

The United Nations says people age 65 and older are the fastest-growing age group worldwide. It estimates that by 2050, one out of every six people will be 65 or older, accounting for 16% of the planet's total population, up from 9% in 2011. That figure is even larger in Europe and North America, where the U.N. predicts the number will be closer to 25%. The demand for health-care products and services should only increase as a result. Yes, health-care stocks will be coming off a weak 2019. Through mid-November, the S&P 500 was sitting on nearly 25% gains, while the sector had improved by roughly half that. They'll also have to contend with uncertainty regarding the future of health care as the 2020 presidential election approaches. But don't sleep on the space in the year ahead. For one, health-care stocks tend to outperform during periods of economic weakness. For instance, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) delivered a 39.6% total loss (share price plus dividends) during the 2007-09 bear market - more than 15 percentage points better than the S&P 500.","related":"SP500","image":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/image\/198c13a3-09ff-45da-9fde-25ee39f5bd4f","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1574099294000,"headline":"2019-11-18 - S&P 500 Analysis - Are we Facing the End of the Bull Market?","source":"FXStreet","url":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/article\/df153642-1137-4444-ae66-c48745bf9453","summary":"Amid fresh all-time highs in the U.S. indices, the euphoric corporate earnings, billions of losses reported by unicorns, and pessimistic mood by a tra","related":"SP500","image":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/image\/df153642-1137-4444-ae66-c48745bf9453","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1574095560000,"headline":"AMD Stock Rises Again on More Love From Wall Street","source":"Barron's","url":"https:\/\/cloud.iexapis.com\/v1\/news\/article\/8274e5b3-cd54-442f-9d17-a94b6685a337","summary":"Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 big stock rally has more to go, according to Cowen.
